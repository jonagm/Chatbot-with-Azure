### Explanation of Resources
1. **Knowldge base** The collection of questions and answers for use in our chatbot has been uploaded. Although this document was just the foundation, it was further optimized within the Azure AI Language tools, where prompts were added for each question, in addition to customizing greetings, farewells, and recommendations


### Additional notes
- In the code to implement the bot created in Azure, the secret key of the bot service was used to integrate it into our website. This is not recommended in production environments due to the vulnerabilities it may present, but in this case, it was left this way for development purposes.
